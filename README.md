This repository contains data and light curves for all 235 "Weird Objects of Interest" (WOIs).
The "cofiam" and "phasma" folders contain only the top 30 (by zeta peak) detrended with the respective algorithms.
The "median_filter" folder contains all 219 light curves detrended with a moving median filter using a bandwidth of 1 day.
"woi_data.csv" contains the Tess Input Catalog (TIC) ID, peak zeta value, and period guessed by weirddetector. Note that guessed periods are commonly off by a rational fraction or multiple of the true period.
